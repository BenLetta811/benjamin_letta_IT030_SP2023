    <h2> About Myself</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Morristown, New Jersey. I have a sister who will graduate high school the same time graduate in 2024. I have done many things before attending college.I have an interest in Martial Arts since I was younger and have been doing tae kwon do for nearly 10+ years. Iâ€™m  Second Degree Black Belt and join an assistant instructor program back in 2018 where I volunteer to help students in classes. I do have hobbies such as playing music. I have been in the band since middle school and play the baritone horn(euphonium). I did 4 years in marching band and wind ensemble. I am interested in computers and have taken two computer science classes such as html and python. I did an short internship with Mayo Performing Arts Center which is a local theater in the town I live. I join a program it when I was a senior to give me insight to prepare for getting a job. That is wher I created m first resume and offer an internship after the program. My position was simple to do online advesting for future events on execl to gather the data. In college,  I have acquired skills for Python, Execl, Microsoft Access, and SQL. Last semester, I pass the mircosoft execl associate certification which is a prerequisite for one of my business classes, but does help for future job positions</p>

    <p>I have done other jobs such as being a busser for Buffalo Wild Wings for short time in the summer of 2021. I came back to Tae kwon Do working part time as an assistant instructor during summer and winter breaks after a semester.</p> 

    <p>I have been involve in religious trips such as a mission for Appalachihia Outreach in Kentucky. Involoing 25 members to come down in one of the poorest county in the country to help rebuild homes for families to help,
