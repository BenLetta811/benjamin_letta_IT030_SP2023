	  				wanted to help out classes during the summer and to get payed. I accepted since 
	  				it's a cool opportunity to assist other students about Tae Kwon Do. It is really 
	  				fun but also rough at times. I work 6 hrs part time from 3pm to 9pm Mon-Fri $15 an hour.

	  			<p> The Assistant Instructor Training Program was offered to black belts or people with longer term experience in the school to help assist the head instructor with training the younger and new students. This was offered to me since I've been doing this for a long time. The requirement was to join one of the class times through 45 mins to do stretching and demonstration for the class. After class, I would record my hours in a sheet which counts as community service. There would even be meetings that are held in a few months to help the other assistant instructors teach classes and what events are coming up.

	  			<p>I've stop since I applied to college and couldn't no longer train their any more since the driving distance is far. It still a good time. This role has helped me with giving community service hours which help me get to the national honor society in high school.
